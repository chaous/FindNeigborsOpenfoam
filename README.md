# FindNeigborsOpenfoam
To use this addon, compile it first (you need to have openfoam installed (openfoam2206 was used for tests but should work with all versions)) by running
## ```./Allwmake```
Then just type getNeigbors in your directory with simulation and my code will generate cellPairs.txt file with neighbors list
